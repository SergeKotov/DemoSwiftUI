         subtitle: "The stunning arts, games, and the harmonious vision of Nature",
         description:
         """
         In his epic poem The Odyssey, Homer described the island of Crete as “out in the wine-dark sea . . . a rich and lovely sea-girt land, densely peopled, with 90 cities and several different languages.” Crete was the birthplace of the mighty Minoan civilization, which is one of the oldest in Europe. It appeared two thousand years before the birth of Homer. The Greeks will later call the Minoan supremacy “thalassocracy” or “the empire of the sea” spread throughout the Mediterranean.

         The Minoans had no city walls and built no temples. They did not conquer the world with armies of warriors. But their stunning architecture and amazing arts deeply influenced the Mycenaean civilization – the era of mythical heroes, sung by Homer much later.

         We are strongly inspired by how the Minoans felt nature and perceived the world.
         The origin of the Helius' world is based on that conscious harmonious vision of Nature.

         The beauty of Minoan arts still amazes people. But many other things matter to us as well. For example, games. Acrobatic, competitive, and of course, board games. The most famous game of Knossos is kept at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum on Crete, but there are others.

         We believe that the renowned Phaistos disc, which purpose remains disputed, was also a kind of a game. Helius’ intends to include almost all of the Minoan games.

         Welcome!

         title: "Ancient Greek Paideia",
         subtitle: "A perfect way to educate people",
         description:
         """
         The term Paideia (παιδεία) refers to the education system in classical Greek and Greco-Roman cultures. It derives from the Greek pais, paidos: the upbringing of the child (related to pedagogy and pediatrics).

         In the early Christian era, it served as a model of higher learning and was aimed at bringing up an ideal member of society. Paideia included both arts and sciences: rhetoric, music, poetry, mathematics, geography, natural history, philosophy, and gymnastics.

         The idea of Paideia is superior intelligence and physical abilities.

         Later Paideia became the equivalent of the Latin Humanitas (from which “the humanities”), signifying the general learning that should be the possession of all human beings. It evolved through the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Modern periods.

         The concept of Helius’ is based on the Paideia-oriented idea of the centrality of human knowledge. It embraces the integral holistic vision of the human mind and reactions as well.

         We especially stimulate creative thinking and adaptive decisions.

         The name Helius’ is rooted in Ancient Greek mythology and has a long history. We will talk about it in future blog posts.

         title: "The Mechanical Age",
         subtitle: "The mechanization of a logical calculus",
         description:
         """
         In the 13th century, Raymundus Lullius created a logical machine in the form of paper circles. These circles together embraced the whole field of possible knowledge: from divinity to law and medicine. This logical system that received the name Ars Magna (The Great Art) was made to help discover the truth. The system is described in a treatise entitled “Ars magna generalis.”

         In the 17th century, Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator. He presented it as a machine that could perform calculations that were previously thought to be only humanly possible.

         In the 19th century, Charles Babbage invented a programmable analytical engine. It was a mechanical general-purpose computer.

         These inventions, along with the works of Kepler, Newton, Leibniz, and many other scientists and philosophers, gave rise to the mechanical vision of natural processes.

         As every computer program, Helius’ uses the mechanical vision of logical processes. However, it takes into account the recursive nature of matter. This is a very attractive idea that is close to the original vision of “Ars magna generalis.”

         title: "From Psyche to Intelligence",
         subtitle: "The human mind as the Universe",
         description:
         """
         Another aspect of the mechanical revolution was the transition from psyche (or soul) to mind as to a set of dynamic physiological functions or a universal matter. Rene Descartes: “Cogito ergo sum” or, “I think, therefore I am.”

         Contrary to mechanics, psychology has never been a universal science and is still shifting between various contradictory hypotheses and theories.

         In the 20th century, special tests were made to assess human intelligence. The most popular is still the IQ test. It moved away from the psyche and introduced a complex score as an indicator of brainpower.

         The artificial intelligence engine of the Helius’ app can generate all classic types of IQ tests. We only do not offer any verbal tasks due to language and cultural differences.

         What makes Helius’ special is that it also has an emotional side along with the intelligent one. These emotions, however, do not come from psychology but rather from neuroscience. See the next part of the story for details.

         subtitle: "Cybernetics and artificial intelligence: a holistic vision of nature, mind, and machine",
         description:
         """
         The term feedback originated in the world of regulatory mechanisms. At first, it described only the action of “returning to an earlier position” within a mechanical process.
         By the 1950s, feedback acquired a more precise definition, “circularity of action,” still limited to mechanisms. Awareness of feedback to control machines and social processes has an exceptional value for the viability of humankind.
         Cyberneticians, such as Alan Turing, W. Grey Walter, and W. Ross Ashby, drew heavily on these ideas to understand and model the brain.
         The modern world of the 21st century is somewhat a consequence of the cybernetic revolution. Many processes are now driven by artificial intelligence.
         In 1972, another cybernetician Stafford Beer wrote a book, “Brain of the firm,” where he suggested the Viable System Model or VSM. Explaining the patterns of viable systems, Beer refers to Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety.
         Now imagine a program that embraces all of the above. The Helius’ structure and organization are based on a holistic vision of control, the Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety, and the Beer’s Viable System Model in mind.

         description:
         """
         A computer is an artificial device for modeling processes that occur in the organic computer called the brain. This invention was an inevitable milestone in human social evolution.

         Powered by computer-based systems, human culture has great opportunities to centralize itself as a whole and become a kind of a gigantic united organization, despite contradictory intentions of cultural and political formations.

         Software evolved from primitive computing mechanisms to complex sets of programs organized hierarchically. They now can model dynamic environments and create artificial worlds.

         Helius’ software is designed in such a way that it adopts human intelligence to improve human abilities.

         Strange as it might seem, but Helius’ uses two of the very old but powerful programming languages for interaction with a human. These are LISP and BASIC. However, now the algorithms are transformed to the modern programming language Swift and Apple iOS.

         The highest point of every organization is a state when all its parts are tightly connected. The global network powered by Internet technology is a predetermined evolutionary outcome of the cultural and technological development of human organizations. It’s a weak point, too.

         Just like the variety in Nature is the key factor in preserving life, the variety in Intelligence is the key factor in preserving the stability of human civilization. The reason is that the variety in Intelligence is a source for the variety of decisions.

         Who makes decisions on Earth? For the outside observer, perhaps, the answer is different from an anthropocentric vision.

         The Helius’ concept follows a “peer-to-all” communicative approach. We protect private data about the abilities of the mind but provide the opportunity to share achievements.

         As the world evolved with an increasing speed of changes, humans began searching for a personal advisor. That is someone or something that could help improve their abilities to keep up with the pace and yet stay full of life.
         This global need for both personal advice and pleasure began with a revolution of personal computers in the early 80s. It continued with smartphones and global cloud services. What will be the next key feature of a universal cultural evolution?
         Helius’ is designed for thinking people with a primary goal to improve their creative abilities. This is achieved by solving various never-repeated puzzles with an increasing level of complexity. As the player reaches the shelf of self-abilities, he or she may enter a kind of “self-learning creative mode” to make the right meta-decisions and develop further.
         It’s time to take the first step in this exciting journey. Welcome to Helius’.
